                  products added or sales traffic. It became clear that after some users created accounts, they had
                  problems in finding ideas for what to sell. This was a cause of frustration for users and Shopify.</p>

        <h3 class="secondaryCaseTitle">Research</h3>

        <p>The project began by scoping the task with the team and a business analyst. Together, we set goals, outlined
          requirements, and calculated the expected return on investment (ROI). My task was to create a solution that
          effectively communicated Shopify's values of being user-friendly, and aligned with its design principles and
          content strategy.</p>
        <br>
        <p>To understand the project's technical constraints and expectations, I conducted stakeholder interviews with
          the team. We identified key performance indicators (KPIs) that included:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>— Increasing the number of new stores actively adding products.</li>
          <li>— Increase positive customer feedback.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>I had a day-long competitor analysis session, researching e-commerce, trends and SEO tracking. Since the
          development team expressed interest in scraping data from competitors, my focus was primarily on platforms
          like AliExpress, Amazon, eBay, and sources such as Google Trends and Google Shopping Insights. The goal was to
          identify any design patterns and mental models related to user flows.</p>
        <img src="/dev/assets/shop-4.png" alt="A screenshot of e-commerce sites for competitor research.">
        <p class="caption">Some competitor research focusing on e-commerce design patterns.</p>
        <p>I held interview sessions with five different users in order to hear how they actually use Shopify,
          ranging
          from beginners to seasoned business owners who ran Shopify stores full-time. The success metrics emerged
          as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>— Reduce the risk of users being overwhelmed after setting up a store.</li>
          <li>— Give users the opportunity to find products that the public demands.</li>
          <li>— Boost sales for users.</li>
        </ul>
        <img src="/dev/assets/shop-5.png" alt="A notebook with some notes about user testing.">
        <p class="caption">Some rough notes from condensing user interview data into contextual information.</p>

        <p>To cater to different user demographics, I created two personas based on interview insights. These personas
          were given motivations, goals, and frustrations, allowing me to better align my design decisions with their
          goals.</p>
        <br>
        <p> To understand user needs and potential user journeys, I employed a mind map approach. This allowed me to
          structure ideas, uncover patterns and highlight key focus areas. Results of this analysis included:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>— Searching.</li>
          <li>— Related items.</li>
          <li>— Categories.</li>
          <li>— New and trending.</li>
          <li>— Trust.</li>
        </ul>
        <img src="/dev/assets/shop-6.png" alt="A screenshot of user personas.">
        <p class="caption">Two personas were created to help design decisions.</p>


        <p>All this data was then sorted and prioritised. I used affinity diagramming to develop ideas around
          functionality:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>— Recommend trending products.</li>
          <li>— Help users to feel confident that their products will sell.</li>
          <li>— Suggest product categories and specific products. </li>
          <li>— Allow users to search for and filter products.</li>
          <li>— Avoid overwhelming the user with too many options.</li>
          <li>— Be user-friendly for beginners and mobile users. </li>
          <li>— Fit into Shopify's main functionality.</li>
        </ul>
        <img src="/dev/assets/shop-7.png" alt="Sticky notes on a window during affinity diagramming.">
        <p class="caption">Affinity diagramming helped categorise ideas around areas of improvement.</p>


        <p>Using SEO, the app would highlight and recommend products that have high search volume, and low competition
          with other Shopify stores. Basically, products that are in demand and have low presence in online
          marketplaces.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Iteration of ideas led to the homepage resembling a to-do list, so users can understand where they are in the
          process and earn a feeling of completion when they complete the steps. This progression would also likely
          drive users to complete all the steps. Though development of the site map, the user flow emerged:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>— Browse product categories for one of interest.</li>
          <li>— Add products from categories to a saved products list.</li>
          <li>— Customize product information in the saved products list.</li>
          <li>— Use search volume data to see if chosen products are unique enough to stand out in a marketplace.</li>
          <li>— Push products to store.</li>
          <li>— See and register with related available domains and social media accounts.</li>
          <li>— Start selling.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="caption">Early notes showing the user flow idea of a to-do list.</p>


        <h3 class="secondaryCaseTitle">Design</h3>
        <p>At this point I began paper sketches, allowing for experimentation while considering persona needs. These
          initial sketches served as a foundation and were refined into wireframes to show interactions.</p>
        <img src="/dev/assets/shop-9.png" alt="Quick sketches showing a user flow idea.">

        <p class="caption">Sketches around the ideas for interactions and user flows.</p>

        <h3 class="secondaryCaseTitle">Prototype</h3>
        <p>Once I’d reached a complete user flow, the wireframes were developed into a low-fidelity prototype. To
          confirm my assumptions, I organised a user testing session involving five participants with varying levels of
          experience. This diverse group included two individuals who were aware of Shopify but had never used it,
          representing the demographic of beginner Shopify users.</p>
        <br>
        <p>During the day-long testing session, participants were presented with a task-completion list, and their
          interactions with the prototype were observed and analysed.</p>
        <img src="/dev/assets/shop-11.png" alt="A screenshot of wireframe prototypes.">
        <p class="caption">A wireframe prototype with basic functionality of the user flow.</p>

        <p>After testing, it became clear that some parts of the user flow needed to be simplified. The idea of a
          product shortlist seemed to be unnecessary, and I decided it should be removed for the initial MVP and
          reconsidered after more research. After the flow of the design had been updated I then used InVision to build
          a high-fidelity prototype.</p>
        <br>
        <p>To validate the changes and gather more feedback, another user feedback session was conducted. Five
          participants were presented with a task-completion list that reflected the user journey. The feedback received
          included:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>— Positive feedback from new users who appreciated the tool for providing product ideas to sell.</li>
          <li>— Users acknowledging that the feature was introduced at an appropriate point in the user flow.</li>
          <li>— Recognition that the focus on trending search volumes enabled users to tap into popular product trends
            effectively.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="secondaryCaseTitle">Build</h3>
        <p>UI work began, and I collaborated with the development team to confirm the user flow and UI. Any new
          components I created were added into Shopify’s existing Polaris design system.</p>
        <br>
        <p>As the design work progressed, a key team member left Shopify. A decision was made to discontinue the project
          based on evolving business requirements. As a result, my ongoing work was absorbed into the strategic backlog
          for potential future product improvements.</p>
