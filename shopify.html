                <p>Shopify allows users to create and operate an online store without coding knowledge. I was contacted
                  by a team who had a project to develop a tool.

        <h2 class="caseTitle">The challenge</h2>
        <p>Shopify had a problem where some users were not selling products, after setting up a store. </p>
        <h2 class="caseTitle">The goal</h2>
        <p>Produce a tool that recommends trending products to new users.</p>

        <h2 class="caseTitle">The process</h2>

        <h3 class="secondaryCaseTitle">Understand</h3>
        <p>I organized a stakeholder session to brainstorm and share ideas with users, developers, and product managers.
          We sketched out ideas, discussed them, and gave our thoughts.</p>

        <h3 class="secondaryCaseTitle">Research</h3>
        <p>I interviewed a variety of users, from beginners to business owners running a Shopify store full-time. I
          identified success metrics for the product:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>• Help users avoid feeling overwhelmed after setting up their store.</li>
          <li>• Help users find products that are in high demand/trending.</li>
          <li>• Boost sales for users.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="secondaryCaseTitle">Analyze</h3>
        <p>I started identifying goals, creating personas based on the user interviews. These were:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>• A beginner looking to build a long-term brand.</li>
          <li>• An existing seller wanting to sell something in demand.</li>
        </ul>
        <img src="/dev/assets/shopifypersonas.png" alt="A graphic of the two personas used to direct decision making.">
        <p class="caption">User interviews led to two personas being created.</p>
        <p>I now knew the main requirements of the product:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>• Recommend trending products.</li>
          <li>• Help users feel confident their products will sell.</li>
          <li>• Suggest product categories and specific products.</li>
          <li>• Allow users to search for and filter products.</li>
          <li>• Avoid overwhelming the user with too many options.</li>
          <li>• Be user-friendly for beginners and mobile users.</li>
          <li>• Fit into Shopify's main functionality.</li>
        </ul>

        <img src="/dev/assets/stickynotes.jpg"
          alt="A window with lots of sticky notes on it, showing the research process.">
        <p class="caption">I used sticky notes during planning the journey map for flexible and quick ideas.</p>
        <p>The product was defined as an app which can be installed onto a user’s dashboard. The app will guide the user
          to getting their store stocked, registered with a domain, and ready to sell. The working title was ‘Niche
          Finder’.</p>
        <p>
          Using SEO metrics, the app would highlight and recommend products that have high search volume, and low
          competition with other stores. Basically, products that are in demand and have low presence in online
          marketplaces.
        </p>
        <p>
          Users would find a trending product niche, choose products, and push them to their store. Products would be
          pulled in from AliExpress, with product data
          scraped from Thieve. The ability to register for a domain and social media accounts, using existing Shopify
          tools, would drive the idea of setting up a brand with opportunity for growth, and not just a store.
        </p>

        <h3 class="secondaryCaseTitle">Sketch</h3>
        <p>I created a user journey, and started creating different layout designs while considering the needs of the
          user. I kept in mind:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>• Which UI elements would users interact with most frequently?</li>
          <li>• How would text affect the user experience? </li>
          <li>• What are the best practices for e-commerce UX?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I came up with the idea of the homepage resembling a to-do list so users can understand where they are in the
          process. Though development of the journey map, the basic steps emerged as:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>• Browse product categories for one of interest.
          </li>
          <li>• Add products from categories to shortlist of saved products.
          </li>
          <li>• Customize product information in shortlist.
          </li>
          <li>• Use search volume data to see if chosen products are unique enough to stand out in a marketplace.
          </li>
          <li>• Push products to store.
          </li>
          <li>• See and register with related available domains and social media accounts.
          </li>
          <li>•Start selling in store.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="caption">A sketch of ideas for the user journey.</p>
        <h3 class="secondaryCaseTitle">Wireframes and prototype</h3>
        <p>Once I’d reached a detailed journey map, sketches were developed into a prototype. This was tested with
          people who were aware of Shopify as a company but who were not users, to capture the target audience of
          beginner users.
        </p>
        <img src="/dev/assets/shopifywireframe.png" alt="A wireframe of one screen of the user journey.">
        <p class="caption">A wireframe of a homescreen idea.</p>
        <h3 class="secondaryCaseTitle">Test design and iterate</h3>
        <p>After testing, it emerged that the idea of a shortlist of saved products wasn’t a priority to the users. I
          made changes to the prototype and presented the results of the user testing with the product team.
          I laid out all screens in Sketch, making sure existing Shopify components aligned with the new design.

        <p class="caption">I began laying out all screens using the in-house design system and components.</p>
        <h2 class="caseTitle">Result</h2>
        <p>The product had overall positive feedback in the final prototype testing session. Design was ready and
          development began until some members of the team left, and work was discontinued.
