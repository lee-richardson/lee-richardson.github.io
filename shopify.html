                <h3>Description ↴</h3>
                <p>Aligning with business needs, I carried out research to find user needs, and designed a new tool
                  aimed at beginner users. Working in agile sprints, the project took almost a year, and I worked as the
                  only designer on a product team.</p>

                <h3>The challenge ↴</h3>
                <p>Through analytics, Shopify knew some stores were being created but remaining inactive, without any
                  products
                  being added or sales traffic. It seemed that after creating an account, some users had trouble finding
                  ideas
                  of what to sell. Clearly, this was a cause of frustration for Shopify and its users.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="whatelement">
                <h3>The goal ↴</h3>
                <p>Utilize user research to find issues and create a tool that offers ideas of what to sell. As part of
                  the
                  larger Shopify product, the solution should share the same vision and design principles of Shopify.

        <p class="caption">Notes from the kickoff meeting setting out business requirements.</p>

        <p>The team kicked off the project with a business analyst to set up goals, requirements and <span
            class="boldText">return on investment (ROI).</span> I had to find a solution that shared the vision, design
          principles and content strategy of
          Shopify.</p>
        <p>I carried out <span class="boldText">stakeholder interviews</span> with the product team, consisting of two
          project managers, two SEO
          specialists and three back-end developers. These interviews were to find technical constraints and project
          expectations. <span class="boldText">Key Performance Indicators (KPI)</span> included:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>• Increase stores that are actively adding products.</li>
          <li>• Increase positive customer feedback.</li>
        </ul>
        <img src="/dev/assets/shop-3.png" alt="A notebook with some notes.">
        <p class="caption">Notes from the stakeholder interviews around product vision and goals.</p>
        <p>I began a day-long <span class="boldText">competitor analysis</span> session. This was to find any common
          <span class="boldText">design patterns</span> and <span class="boldText">mental models</span> in terms of user
          flows.

        <p class="caption">Some competitor research focusing on e-commerce design patterns.</p>
        <p>An analytics tool provided the data needed for <span class="boldText">quantitative research,</span> but I
          needed to find user insights
          through <span class="boldText">qualitative research.</span> To explore user requirements, I facilitated
          interviews over two days with five
          users, from beginners to business owners running a Shopify store full-time.</p>
        <img src="/dev/assets/shop-5.png" alt="A notebook with some notes about user testing.">
        <p class="caption">Some rough notes from condensing user interview data into contextual information.</p>
        <p>To help target different user demographics, I created two <span class="boldText">personas</span> based on
          patterns found in my interview insights. These were given motivations, goals and frustrations. I worked to
          empathetically align with both
          personas in order to meet the user goals.</p>
        <img src="/dev/assets/shop-6.png" alt="A notebook with some notes about user testing.">
        <p class="caption">Some rough notes from condensing user interview data into contextual information.</p>
        <p>I used a <span class="boldText">mind map</span> to identify user flow issues and an overview of user needs.
          This was useful to see if any
          patterns emerged and to find inspiration of what to focus on. Results included:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>• Searching.</li>
          <li>• Related items.</li>
          <li>• Categories.</li>
          <li>• New and trending.</li>
          <li>• Trust.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="caseTitle">Develop</h3>
        <p>With quantitative and qualitative data gathered, I used <span class="boldText">affinity diagramming</span> to
          develop ideas around
          functionality:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>• Recommend trending products.</li>
          <li>• Help users to feel confident that their products will sell.</li>
          <li>• Suggest product categories and specific products. </li>
          <li>• Allow users to search for and filter products.</li>
          <li>• Avoid overwhelming the user with too many options.</li>
          <li>• Be user-friendly for beginners and mobile users. </li>
          <li>• Fit into Shopify's main functionality.</li>
        </ul>
        <img src="/dev/assets/shop-7.png" alt="Sticky notes on a window during affinity diagramming.">
        <p class="caption">Affinity diagramming helped categorize ideas for functionality.</p>
        <p>Using SEO, the app would highlight and recommend products that have high search volume, and low competition
          with other Shopify stores. Basically, products that are in demand and have low presence in online
          marketplaces.</p>
        <p><span class="boldText">Iteration of ideas</span> led to the homepage resembling a to-do list, so users can
          understand where they are in the
          process and earn a feeling of completion when they complete the steps. This progression would also likely
          drive users to complete all the steps.</p>

        <p>Though development of the site map, the user flow emerged:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>• Browse product categories for one of interest.</li>
          <li>• Add products from categories to a saved products list.</li>
          <li>• Customize product information in the saved products list.</li>
          <li>• Use search volume data to see if chosen products are unique enough to stand out in a marketplace.</li>
          <li>• Push products to store.</li>
          <li>• See and register with related available domains and social media accounts.</li>
          <li>• Start selling.</li>

        <p class="caption">Sketches around the ideas for interactions and user flows.</p>
        <p>With functionality laid out, I needed ideas around the user flow. At this point I began sketching, allowing
          for experimentation while considering persona needs. Once I’d reached a complete user flow, the sketches were
          cleaned up and developed into a <span class="boldText">low-fidelity prototype.</span> I facilitated a <span
            class="boldText">user testing session</span> with five people
          at different levels of experience. Two people were aware of Shopify but not users, to capture the demographic
          of beginner Shopify users. A task-completion list was provided, and the testing session lasted a day.</p>

        <p class="caption">An expanded view of the wireframe prototypes.</p>
        <p>After testing, it became clear that some parts of the user flow needed to be simplified. The idea of a
          shortlist seemed to be unnecessary, and I decided it should be removed for the initial MVP and reconsidered
          after more research. After the flow of the design had been updated I refined the prototype, and <span
            class="boldText">presented results</span> with the team.</p>
        <p>The product had overall positive feedback in the final testing session. This involved a task-completion list
          involving adding finding a category idea, adding products registering a domain. Feedback included:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>• New users appreciating the tool offering ideas for products to sell.</li>
          <li>• Users understanding that the tool came at a correct time in the user onboarding flow.</li>
          <li>• The focus on trending search volumes allowed users to utilize popular products.</li>

        <p class="caption">Screenshots showing the development of the UI, and how the design aligns with the larger
          Shopify product.</p>
        <p>UI work began, and I collaborated with the development team to provide components and review development work
          to confirm the user flow and UI. Any new components I created were added into Shopify’s existing <span
            class="boldText">design system.</span></p>
        <h3 class="caseTitle">Deliver</h3>
        <p>Design was continuing and development sprints began until a key member of the team left. Business
          requirements decided work should discontinue, and my research was absorbed into Shopify’s UX team’s work.</p>
