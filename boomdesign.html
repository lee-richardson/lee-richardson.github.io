                <h3>Description ↴</h3>
                <p>I kickstarted a design system project which allowed us to design user interfaces faster. I worked
                  with another designer on the project over two two-week agile sprints.

                <h3>The challenge ↴</h3>
                <p>Hero’s design team was working across 7 brands, all using different components. Also some older
                  products didn’t have components, so we were rebuilding each component every time a new user interface
                  was needed.

        <h3 class="secondaryCaseTitle">Discover</h3>
        <p>The team was using screenshots and wireframes for prototyping, which was becoming time-intensive. To optimise
          the team’s work, I proposed a design system that would allow us to design more efficiently and allow for quick
          experimentation.
          I took a step back to evaluate if it was the perfect timing. I analyzed the Hero roadmap to ensure my proposal
          aligned seamlessly with our long-term goals. Connecting with the development team, we discussed how the design
          system could integrate smoothly with existing projects.
          I began reading documentation and exploring other design systems for best practices.
        </p>
        <h3 class="secondaryCaseTitle">Define</h3>
        <p>I began breaking down a product - Boom Casino - and analyzing the atomic structure of the user interface.
          This allowed me to understand the layers of components that I would need to create.
          When the Boom design system had been completed, the structure would be applied to the other products under the
          Hero Gaming umbrella.
        </p>
        <h3 class="secondaryCaseTitle">Develop</h3>
        <p>Moving on to the next step, I kickstarted designing the components. For these initial versions, we usually
          reach out to a small, rotating group of people for feedback. This way, we get a variety of perspectives
          without disrupting the entire product, design, and engineering teams. As we refine the iterations, we started
          focusing on specific details. For example, we consider how the component will appear in a dark mode, what it
          will look like when keyboard focus is on it, and even its minimum width (if that's relevant).

        </p>
        <h3 class="secondaryCaseTitle">Deliver</h3>
        <p>On completion I gave a presentation to design team, and access to the design system was shared. <a
            href="https://www.figma.com/file/oADnc2cT8OMIWIBvly0wvz/Boom-Design-System?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=xLYTfBuQUrrUyRoK-0">See
            the Figma file here.</a>
        </p>
        <h3 class="secondaryCaseTitle">Result</h3>
        <p>The design system allowed for streamlined workflow, enhanced collaboration, and ensured consistency.
          Designers are empowered to focus on ideas and innovation, resulting in better user experiences and a stronger
          brand identity.
