        <h3 class="secondaryCaseTitle">Research</h3>
        <p>The design team relied on meetings, syncs and group decisions to maintain a cohesive UI and consistent UX
          patterns. This was working but barely, with designers often waiting until a meeting or group-call to confirm
          on components and design patterns. This was proving to be inefficient.</p>
        <br>
        <p> To streamline the team's workflow and improve efficiency, I introduced the idea of implementing a design
          system. This system would enable us to design more efficiently and facilitate rapid experimentation. Before
          proposing this change, I reviewed the roadmap to ensure that it aligned with our long-term goals. The design
          team quickly jumped on board by realising its potential.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I also collaborated with the development team to explore how the design system could integrate with our
          existing projects, and if it could be maintained by both the design and development sides.
          I began breaking down the product, and mapping out all of the components from simplest to most complex. During
          this process, we established clear and optimal guidelines for design and implementation.

        <p class="caption">We reviewed all screens and broke them down into component sections.</p>

        <p class="caption">An example of the Boom and AmuletoBet navigation structures.</p>
        <h3 class="secondaryCaseTitle">Design</h3>
        <p>We began designing the components by first looking at the basic elements like typography, colours, inputs,
          and buttons. These elements were made to detached from any specific context.</p>
        <br>
        <p>We also made sure that our design
          was inclusive, meaning it considered the needs of people with different types of disabilities, whether they're
          permanent, temporary, or situational. We checked our current website for any visual or technical issues
          related to accessibility, following the WCAG 2.1 guidelines, and fixed them in our new design system. This
          way, Boom will be accessible to as many people as possible in the future.</p>
        <br>
        In terms of the project's scope, we designed it to be flexible so that it can easily include other brands from
        the Hero portfolio in the future, making our design system adaptable and scalable.</p>
        <br>
        <p>We set up some basic rules for how colours, typography, and spacing should look. Then we reviewed simple
          atoms like buttons, input fields, and forms. Because we had these simple rules in place, it became easy to
          create the larger components. Each new component we made therefore followed the same rules and took cues from
          the components we already had.</p>

        <p class="caption">The typography styles were defined with generic names instead of specific ones.</p>

        <p>On completion I gave a presentation to the design team, and access to the design system was shared. <a
