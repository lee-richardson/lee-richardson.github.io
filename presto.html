        <h2 class="caseTitle">Finding the problem</h2>
        <p>During Juno College's UX course, I had to find a problem relevant to Torontonians, and design a new app as a
          solution. I decided to address commuting and Presto, the digital fare payment system.</p>
        <p>Presto has been around since 2009, originally promoted as an alternative to having to wait in line to buy
          physical tokens and monthly metropasses. With wider rollout across the GTA, Presto can now be used on 11
          transit agencies in Ontario, even including Ottawa’s transit system.</p>
        <p>When I started the project in 2016, Presto was envisioned as the future of travel in Ontario, with the
          provincial government aiming to move all payments away from physical methods to Presto by 2019.</p>
        <img src="/dev/assets/hellopresto.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Because of the impact on hundreds of thousands of Ontarians, I knew there could be opportunities for ideas
          for improving Presto.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="caseStudy research">
        <h2 class="caseTitle">Strategy</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>• Product objectives</li>
          <li>• Success metrics</li>
          <li>• User research</li>
          <li>• User needs</li>
          <li>• Personas</li>
          <li>• Empathy maps</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I had to find whether there was enough demand before deciding that designing an NFC app made sense. I headed
          into the Entertainment District and Financial District during afternoon rush hour over three days. I
          interviewed people at TTC stops, inside stations and on streetcars and subways. I also went through the Presto
          top-up system with some interviewees at Union Station.</p>
        <p>With field research done, I wanted to interview commuters in a more formal setting. I facilitated interview
          sessions, learning about opinions, habits, and feelings around mobile payments. I developed a Google survey,
          sharing it through social media and Slack, that over 45 people filled out. It included questions on
          demographics, Presto, ecommerce and payment security.</p>
        <h3>Survey results</h3>
        <p>
          Analyzing the data, I found common patterns about the typical commuter:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>• Most people use their phone while commuting, including podcasts, maps and some banking.</li>
          <li>• Most pay by cash or tokens, then Presto, then Metropass.</li>
          <li> • Presto users think cash is inconvenient, and they can skip waiting in ticket lines.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Of those questioned, the majority (63%) would use a mobile payment app if one was available. This gave me
          confidence in continuing with the idea.</p>
        <h3>Personas</h3>
        <p>I found that distilling these user needs into a persona helpful to define the scope of the project and ensure
          I was designing a solution that was truly human centric. I took my data while trying to find patterns. Two
          clear TTC users emerged: The surburban commuter and the downtown resident.</p>
        <img src="/dev/assets/prestopersonas.jpg" alt="two personas">
        <h3 class="secondaryCaseTitle">A more inclusive design for everyone</h3>
        <p>I was aware that most of my user interviews had been with riders who lived downtown. To stop the end design
          from becoming poorly designed for users who weren’t reflections of people that live downtown.</p>
        <p>To move beyond biases, I spoke to people who lived in the suburbs, and a couple of people who commuted from
          Hamilton daily.
          This information allowed me to approach thinking of ideas while designing for everyone, everywhere. </p>

          <li>• Features and functionality</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In what other cities were commuters able to pay through NFC? I found a few transit systems around the world,
          checked out their pros and cons, and compared them to see if any features were common across the board.</p>
        <img src="/dev/assets/prestocompetition@2x.png" alt="screenshots of other transit agencies and ticket apps">
        <ul>
          <li>• HopOn: Add money to a balance and show the phone to the driver to pay. An animated confirmation screen
            means it is difficult to fraud. Swipe navigation, easy to navigate.</li>
          <li>• JustRide MTA: Activate the ticket in a digital wallet before boarding. Has options for 10 trips, a
            month, one-way, roundtrip, weekly.
          </li>
          <li>• Ventra: Uses a top up system. Interesting payment confirmation uses an animation that changes
            colour when accepted/denied.
          </li>
          <li>• Mainline: Meant for longer, less frequent trips than Presto. Choice of one-way or return. Pay with
            credit card or PayPal. Ticket is a QR code that is scanned by train staff on board.</li>
          <li>• MBTA: Boston's transit system. Buy and store tickets that you need. Before riding, activate and
            show to staff if asked.

          <li>• Iterative concepts</li>
        </ul>
        <p>With a list of required features and a high-level concept, the app needed laying out. I began fleshing out
          the
          information architecture, deciding how a user would progress through the app.</p>

        <h3 class="secondaryCaseTitle">Designing for edge cases</h3>
        <p>From my user research and personal experience, I knew that a common issue is Presto scanners on streetcars
          and buses malfunctioning, or being completely out of service. With no alternative method to pay for a fare,
          this is obviously an inconvenience and could potentially lead to inadvertent fines for a user. It was clear
          that only offering a tap payment method wasn’t enough. Functionality had to include a method of manually
          activating a fare.

          <li>• Wireframes</li>
        </ul>
        <p>With the information architecture in place, I built a wireframe prototype of the app. I facilitated a round
          of A/B testing with volunteers using Optimizely. After reviewing the outcomes, I continued with the
          successful designs, building them into digital wireframes using Sketch and loaded into InVision.</p>
        <img src="/dev/assets/prestomockup.jpg" alt="hand holding a phone, showing early mock of app design">
        <p>Now with a live prototype, I organized one day of lab testing, where I invited several people to use the app.
          I observed, took notes and interviewed them afterwards about the flow.</p>
        <img src="/dev/assets/testing3.jpg" alt="two people in front of sticky notes during user testing">
        <p>After the testing I found that while the overall flow met the user needs, some minor changes were
          needed on some screens. I implemented these changes based on my test notes and more Optimizely A/B testing.

        <p>Feeling comfortable with the refined design, I designed the design system and user interface, with consistent

        <p>In order to optimize the commuting experience, there was only one thing we needed to know—the rider's
          destination. This framed the design of the user journey, and reflected onto the visual design. Colours were
          checked for readability in low-light conditions, and the app was optimized for one-hand usage - a common way
          of using a phone when a user is on the move.</p>
        <p>The interface design needed to inspire confidence for the majority of users, and those who wanted to assert
          control over their choices needed to know how to discover the features.</p>
