              <p>Responding to both business and user requirements, I collaborated closely with another designer to
                integrate a user-friendly feature
                into the flow, simplifying game discovery for our users.

      <h3 class="secondaryCaseTitle">Research</h3>
      <p>We set time to gather requirements, with stakeholder interviews to determine both the return on investment
        (ROI) and key performance indicators (KPIs) for the project. Insights from our Fullstory analytics software,
        showing that 85% of our player base in Japan used smartphones, confirmed our assumptions for a mobile-first
        design approach.</p>
      <p>While we already had a search functionality in place, our focus on UX benchmarking led us to introduce
        filtering
        capabilities to provide a smoother user experience, surpassing what our competitors offered.</p>
      <br>
      <p>During competitor analysis, we explored other products, signed into them, and browsed their game catalogues.
        While most relied on search functionality, a few products allowed users to apply filters. We researched
        filtering functions outside of iGaming, including the travel booking and e-commerce sectors, to find common
        design patterns.</p>
      <p>By reviewing Fullstory screen recordings, we saw how users navigated and searched for games. This data-driven
        approach enabled us to approach the problem with empathy, pinpointing potential moments of user confusion or
        frustration.</p>
      <img src="/dev/assets/filtcompetitors.jpg" alt="A screenshot of a competitor filtering feature.">
      <p class="caption">Competitor analysis gave us insights into best practices when designing for Japanese users.
      </p>


      <h3 class="secondaryCaseTitle">Design</h3>
      <p>Ideation workshops allowed us to brainstorm and sketch rapid prototypes to explore flow ideas. Our process was
        guided by these UX principles:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>— Fitt’s law: the more distance to a target, and the smaller the size of the target, the longer it takes
          for a user to complete a task.
        </li>
        <li>— Hick’s law: the more options are available, the longer it will take a user to make a decision.
        </li>
        <li>— Cognitive load: the amount of mental effort required to use the feature should be low, and shouldn’t
          overwhelm or confuse users.
        </li>
      </ul>


      <img src="/dev/assets/cas-2c.png" alt="A notebook with more developed flow ideas sketched out.">
      <p class="caption">Still in the paper sketch phase, ideas began to form around feature interactions.</p>

      <p>We identified an issue where Japanese users often prefer not to, or can’t, input English characters. With many
        providers having English characters in their names (e.g., "Evolution Gaming," "Blueprint Gaming"), we found a
        solution to relieve any cognitive load associated with recognising English characters. We chose tiles with logos
        instead of text strings, providing an user-friendly approach.</p>
      <br>
      <p>I developed low-fidelity prototypes to explore how the filtering function could fit into the existing flow. We
        considered mental models related to filtering, making sure that the visual presentation of the filter met users'
        expectations.</p>
      <img src="/dev/assets/cas-3.png" alt="A screenshot of a digital wireframe.">
      <p class="caption">Wireframes helped me explore visual hierarchy, design patterns and mental
        models of interactions.</p>
      <p>To minimise cognitive load, we chose to display only a few tiles in the default
        state. This gives users the option to expand the filter and reveal all tiles if wanted. Also, users can have the
        convenience of searching for games via a search bar. We made sure that the search bar stood out in the visual
        hierarchy, making it easy for users to locate and use.</p>
      <img src="/dev/assets/cas-4.png" alt="A screenshot of a digital wireframe with some notes on the side.">
      <p class="caption">Notes on how the filtering feature fits into the user flow.</p>

      <h3 class="secondaryCaseTitle">Prototype</h3>
      <p>We user tested the low-fidelity prototypes in a workshop involving five Hero Gaming employees who were not
        previously familiar with the product. The results were positive, showing that the user flow caused no confusion,
        and users could find games faster than the existing task-completion time.
        Happy with the outcome, we began creating final components needed for the filter feature.</p>
      <br>
      <p>We created high-fidelity prototypes and tested the feature again in another user testing workshop, again with
        five employees of Hero Gaming unfamiliar with the product. By comparing the test times from this workshop
        against the existing data analytics, we were able to validate users spending less time searching for a game,
        giving them more time to engage with gaming experience. </p>

      <h3 class="secondaryCaseTitle">Build</h3>
      <p>Design was approved by product management and went through handoff to the developers. After development we
        confirmed the flow with the QA team. After a month we analysed the data analytics, and results indicated that
        users were able to find their preferred games more quickly. This met our key performance indicator (KPI) of the
        task.</p>
