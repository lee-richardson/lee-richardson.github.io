              <p>Responding to both business and user requirements, I collaborated closely with another designer to
                integrate a user-friendly feature
                into the flow, simplifying game discovery for our users.

      <h3 class="secondaryCaseTitle">Discover</h3>
      <p>We scheduled a session to gather requirements, conducting <span class="boldText">stakeholder
          interviews.</span> This helped us assess the
        <span class="boldText">return on investment (ROI)</span> and <span class="boldText">key performance indicators
          (KPIs).</span> While our platform had a search
        feature, to enhance the user experience and outperform competitors, we decided to introduce filtering based on
        <span class="boldText">UX benchmarking.</span> With insights from Fullstory analytics, we
        noted that approximately 85% of our Japanese players preferred smartphones, so a mobile-first focus was a
        factor.
      </p>
      <img src="/dev/assets/cas-2.png" alt="A screenshot of a competitor filtering feature.">
      <p class="caption">I took screenshots during competitor analysis to determine any best practices in terms of
        design patterns.
      </p>
      <p>We ran a <span class="boldText">competitor analysis</span> session where we signed into other products and
        browsed for games. While most
        only used search functionality, a couple of products allowed filtering of their game catalogue. We also
        investigated how filtering functions outside of iGaming, focusing on travel booking and e-commerce industries.
        This was to see if any common <span class="boldText">design patterns</span> and UX <span class="boldText">mental
          models</span> emerged.
      </p>
      <h3 class="secondaryCaseTitle">Define</h3>
      <p>We used the Fullstory analytics tool to watch videos of how users navigate and search for games. This gave us
        a better understanding of their experience and guided our design thinking empathetically. By viewing
        screen recordings, we could identify edge cases or moments when users might feel confused or
        frustrated.
      </p>
      <h3 class="secondaryCaseTitle">Develop</h3>
      <p>A couple of ideation workshops took place, with time spent on <span class="boldText">brainstorming</span> and
        <span class="boldText">sketching</span> rapid prototypes of flow ideas.
      </p>
      <img src="/dev/assets/cas-2b.png" alt="A notebook with early flow ideas sketched out.">
      <p class="caption">I quickly sketched ideas to consider flow and interactions.
      </p>
      <p>We sketched ideas that aligned with:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>• Fitt’s law — the further away a target is and the smaller the size of the target, the longer it takes
          for a user to complete a task.
        </li>
        <li>• Hick’s law — the more options are available, the longer it will take a user to make a decision.
        </li>
        <li>Cognitive load - the amount of mental effort required to use the feature should be low, and shouldn’t
          overwhelm or confuse users.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <img src="/dev/assets/cas-2c.png" alt="A notebook with more developed flow ideas sketched out.">
      <p class="caption">Still in the paper sketch phase, ideas began to form around feature interactions.</p>
      <p>A common problem we found is that Japanese users don’t always want to, or can’t, type in English characters.
        Because most providers use English characters (“Evolution Gaming”, “Blueprint Gaming”) we decided to use tiles
        with logos, instead of a dropdown with text content.</p>
      <p>I created <span class="boldText">low-fidelity</span> digital sketches of how the filtering function could
        work within the existing flow. We
        took into account the <span class="boldText">mental model</span> around filtering, so users could recognize
        that the filter should function
        the way it appears.</p>
      <img src="/dev/assets/cas-3.png" alt="A screenshot of a digital wireframe.">
      <p class="caption">Low-fidelity digital sketches helped me explore visual hierarchy, design patterns and mental
        models of interactions.</p>
      <p>We created <span class="boldText">wireframes,</span> and experimented with adding a filter function, keeping
        in mind the law of proximity.
        To reduce the cognitive load during the user flow, we decided to initially display only a few tiles in the
        default state, with a choice to expand the filter and show all tiles. Users could also search for games using
        a searchbar. We made sure that the searchbar stood out in the <span class="boldText">visual hierarchy</span>
        so that users could find it easily.
      </p>
      <img src="/dev/assets/cas-4.png" alt="A screenshot of a digital wireframe with some notes on the side.">
      <p class="caption">Notes on how the filtering feature fits into the user flow.</p>
      <p>We tested the low-fidelity prototypes during a <span class="boldText">user testing</span> workshop with five
        employees of Hero Gaming, who
        weren’t familiar with the product. The response showed that the user flow caused no confusion and allowed
        users to find games quicker than the current <span class="boldText">task-completion</span> time.
      </p>
      <img src="/dev/assets/cas-5.png" alt="A digital wireframe of the flow.">
      <p class="caption">These low-fidelity prototypes were guerilla tested by five people, to give us insights into
        user expectations around the flow.
      </p>
      <p>Happy with the outcome of the user testing workshop, we began creating new components needed for the filter
        feature. These were incorporated into a master design system to speed up our workflow.
      </p>
      <img src="/dev/assets/cas-6.png" alt="A screenshot of the UI in progress.">
      <p class="caption">Work began on the UI. Filter states are shown here.</p>
      <img src="/dev/assets/cas-7.png" alt="Another screenshot of the UI in progress.">
      <p class="caption">A high-fidelity prototype with notes on resetting the filter to a default state.</p>
      <p>We created <span class="boldText">high-fidelity prototypes</span> and tested the feature again in another
        <span class="boldText">user testing workshop,</span> again with five
        employees of Hero Gaming unfamiliar with the product. Comparing workshop test times against the current data
        analytics, we confirmed that there was less time spent finding a game, and less <span class="boldText">cognitive
          load</span> overall.
      </p>
      <h3 class="secondaryCaseTitle">Deliver</h3>
      <p>Design was approved by product management and went through handoff to the developers, and after development
        we confirmed the flow with the QA team.</p>
      <h3 class="secondaryCaseTitle">Successes</h3>
      <p>After a month we analyzed the data analytics and results indicated that users were able to find their
        preferred games more quickly, and with less cognitive load. The easier browsing experience led to increased
        user conversions. This met our <span class="boldText">key
          performance indicator (KPI)</span> of
        the task.
