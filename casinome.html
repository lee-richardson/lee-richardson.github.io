                <p>Based on business and user requirements, we introduced a feature into the user flow to help users
                  find games easier. The task was completed by working with another designer over a two-week agile

        <p>We set up time for <span class="boldText">requirements gathering,</span> where we carried out <span
            class="boldText">stakeholder interviews</span> to determine the
          return on investment (ROI) and key performance indicator (KPI). From using the Fullstory analytics software,
          we knew that around 85% of our players in Japan used smartphones. While we had search functionality, In terms
          of UX <span class="boldText">benchmarking</span> we had to add filtering to give a smoother experience than
          that offered by our competitors.</p>
        <img src="/dev/assets/cas-2.png" alt="A screenshot of a competitor filtering feature.">
        <p class="caption">I took screenshots during competitor analysis to determine any best practices in terms of
          design patterns.
        </p>
        <p>We ran a <span class="boldText">competitor analysis</span> session where we signed into other products and
          browsed for games. While most
          only used search functionality, a couple of products allowed filtering of their game catalogue. We also
          investigated how filtering functions outside of iGaming, focusing on travel booking and e-commerce industries.
          This was to see if any common <span class="boldText">design patterns</span> and UX <span
            class="boldText">mental models</span> emerged.
        </p>
        <h3 class="secondaryCaseTitle">Define</h3>
        <p>We used the Fullstory <span class="boldText">analytics</span> tool to observe video recordings of the <span
            class="boldText">user flow</span> of browsing and searching
          for games in our product. This helped us form an <span class="boldText">empathetic</span> approach to our
          design ideas. Access to screen
          recordings helped us spot any edge cases or moments of user confusion or frustration.
        </p>
        <h3 class="secondaryCaseTitle">Develop</h3>
        <p>A couple of ideation workshops took place, with time spent on <span class="boldText">brainstorming</span> and
          <span class="boldText">sketching</span> rapid prototypes of flow ideas.
        </p>
        <img src="/dev/assets/cas-2b.png" alt="A notebook with early flow ideas sketched out.">
        <p class="caption">I quickly sketched ideas to consider flow and interactions.
        </p>
        <p>We sketched ideas that aligned with:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>• Fitt’s law — the further away a target is and the smaller the size of the target, the longer it takes
            for a user to complete a task.
          </li>
          <li>• Hick’s law — the more options are available, the longer it will take a user to make a decision.
          </li>
          <li>Cognitive load - the amount of mental effort required to use the feature should be low, and shouldn’t
            overwhelm or confuse users.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <img src="/dev/assets/cas-2c.png" alt="A notebook with more developed flow ideas sketched out.">
        <p class="caption">Still in the paper sketch phase, ideas began to form around feature interactions.</p>
        <p>A common problem we found is that Japanese users don’t always want to, or can’t, type in English characters.
          Because most providers use English characters (“Evolution Gaming”, “Blueprint Gaming”) we decided to use tiles
          with logos, instead of a dropdown with text content.</p>
        <p>I created <span class="boldText">low-fidelity</span> digital sketches of how the filtering function could
          work within the existing flow. We
          took into account the <span class="boldText">mental model</span> around filtering, so users could recognize
          that the filter should function
          the way it appears.</p>
        <img src="/dev/assets/cas-3.png" alt="A screenshot of a digital wireframe.">
        <p class="caption">Low-fidelity digital sketches helped me explore visual hierarchy, design patterns and mental
          models of interactions.</p>
        <p>We created <span class="boldText">wireframes,</span> and experimented with adding a filter function, keeping
          in mind the law of proximity.
          To reduce the cognitive load during the user flow, we decided to initially display only a few tiles in the
          default state, with a choice to expand the filter and show all tiles. Users could also search for games using
          a searchbar. We made sure that the searchbar stood out in the <span class="boldText">visual hierarchy</span>
          so that users could find it easily.
        </p>
        <img src="/dev/assets/cas-4.png" alt="A screenshot of a digital wireframe with some notes on the side.">
        <p class="caption">Notes on how the filtering feature fits into the user flow.</p>
        <p>We tested the low-fidelity prototypes during a <span class="boldText">user testing</span> workshop with five
          employees of Hero Gaming, who
          weren’t familiar with the product. The response showed that the user flow caused no confusion and allowed
          users to find games quicker than the current <span class="boldText">task-completion</span> time.
        </p>
        <img src="/dev/assets/cas-5.png" alt="A digital wireframe of the flow.">
        <p class="caption">These low-fidelity prototypes were guerilla tested by five people, to give us insights into
          user expectations around the flow.
        </p>
        <p>Happy with the outcome of the user testing workshop, we began creating new components needed for the filter
          feature. These were incorporated into a master design system to speed up our workflow.
        </p>
        <img src="/dev/assets/cas-6.png" alt="A screenshot of the UI in progress.">
        <p class="caption">Work began on the UI. Filter states are shown here.</p>
        <img src="/dev/assets/cas-7.png" alt="Another screenshot of the UI in progress.">
        <p class="caption">A high-fidelity prototype with notes on resetting the filter to a default state.</p>
        <p>We created <span class="boldText">high-fidelity prototypes</span> and tested the feature again in another
          <span class="boldText">user testing workshop,</span> again with five
          employees of Hero Gaming unfamiliar with the product. Comparing workshop test times against the current data
          analytics, we confirmed that there was less time spent finding a game, and less <span
            class="boldText">cognitive load</span> overall.
        </p>
        <h3 class="secondaryCaseTitle">Deliver</h3>
        <p>Design was approved by product management and went through handoff to the developers, and after development
          we confirmed the flow with the QA team.</p>
        <h2 class="caseTitle">Result</h2>
        <p>After a month we analyzed the data analytics and results indicated that users were able to find their
          preferred games more quickly, and with less cognitive load. This met our <span class="boldText">key
            performance indicator (KPI</span> of
          the task.
