                <p>Hero Gaming wanted to add a feature to its Japanese brand, to help users find games
                  easier.

      <section class="caseStudy research">
        <h2 class="caseTitle">The challenge</h2>
        <p>We realized that users needed help navigating our large game selection. Two designers worked together to make
          this happen.
        </p>
        <h2 class="caseTitle">The goal</h2>
        <p>Add a new feature that allows users to filter games and the companies that created them (called "providers").
        </p>
        <h2 class="caseTitle">The process</h2>
        <h3 class="secondaryCaseTitle">Understand</h3>
        <p>Because analytics showed us our Japanese players mostly used phones, we had to make sure that the feature
          worked smoothly on mobile devices. We also took into account that Japanese users are used to seeing a lot of
          information on the screen at once.
        </p>
        <h3 class="secondaryCaseTitle">Research</h3>
        <p>We already used Fullstory software to track user analytics, so we had a large amount of qualitative data to
          dig through. We started looking at the flow of how users find games, and how many use the already existing
          search function. Access to screen recordings, also through Fullstory, helped us spot any moments of confusion
          or frustration.
        </p>
        <p>
          To think about filtering, we looked at casino gaming, travel booking and e-commerce sites, to see if any
          common patterns emerged.
        </p>

        <p class="caption">Competitor research helped us discover common patterns in game browsing.</p>
        <h3 class="secondaryCaseTitle">Analyze</h3>
        <p>A common problem we found is that Japanese users don’t always want to type in English, as it adds another
          layer of thought which removes them from the gaming experience. Because most providers have English names
          (“Evolution Gaming”, “Blueprint Gaming”) we decided to use tiles with logos, instead of a dropdown with text
          content.
        </p>
        <h3 class="secondaryCaseTitle">Sketch</h3>
        <p>I quickly drew some rough ideas about where we could put the filtering function and how it could work within
          the existing flow. By exploring different options, we were able to choose the most effective placement.
        </p>
        <h3 class="secondaryCaseTitle">Wireframes and prototype</h3>
        <p>We gathered logos from all the game providers and created wireframes. To keep things simple for users, we
          showed only a few filtering options at a time, with a choice to expand the filter. Users could also search for
          games using keywords. We made sure that the search bar stood out so that users could find it easily.

        <p class="caption">Wireframes showing the different states.</p>
        <h3 class="secondaryCaseTitle">Test design and iterate</h3>
        <p>We tested the feature multiple times using prototypes, then ran an A/B test and followed the results using
          Fullstory analytics.
        </p>
        <h2 class="caseTitle">Result</h2>
        <p>Data showed that after the feature was added to the flow, users were able to find their favourite games
          faster.</p>
