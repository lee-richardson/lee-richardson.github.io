      <section class="caseStudy research">
        <h2 class="caseTitle">The challenge</h2>
        <p>With no staff in Brazil, and no real insight into how online casinos operate in Brazil, we were struggling to
          enter the market confidently.
        </p>
        <h2 class="caseTitle">The goal</h2>
        <p>We wanted to launch a product in the new market and stand out with a Unique Selling Point (USP). </p>

        <p>A team was formed to focus on the brand. A product owner was hired in Brazil to give
          context and insight. The rest of the product team included:
        <ul>
          <li>• Stakeholders</li>
          <li>• Developers</li>
          <li>• Two designers - myself and another product designer, collaborating daily.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In order to launch the product quickly, a decision was made to reskin an existing product. This meant the
          design team’s role was to create a brand UI, including logo, colours and typography.
        </p>
        <h2 class="caseTitle">The process</h2>
        <h3 class="secondaryCaseTitle">Understand</h3>
        <p>We needed to define a brand direction, and had a kickoff meeting to create some ideas. Initially we were
          inspired by the Brazilian culture around luck and superstition. We named the site after the amulet that many
          Brazilians carry daily, which is believed to offer protection from harm, ward off evil spirits, and bring good
          fortune, and can usually be found worn as jewelry.
        </p>
        <img src="/dev/assets/amulets.png" alt="Research into the personal good luck charms, amuletos.">
        <p class="caption">Research into the good luck charms called amuletos.</p>
        <p>This theme allowed us to include references to amulets and luck into the design, emphasizing that using our
          site would bring users good luck.</p>
        <h3 class="secondaryCaseTitle">Research</h3>
        <p>We began studying luck, what it means globally and to Brazilians, and how luck can tie into the casino
          experience.</p>
        <p>At this point we began a competitor analysis, to see if a design based around the cocnept of luck would stand
          out against the competition. This analysis included a deep dive into UI and flow of other websites, to see if
          any patterns emerged.</p>

        <p class="caption">We looked at how other casino sites in Brazil set up their landing pages.</p>
        <h3 class="secondaryCaseTitle">Analyze</h3>
        <p>After presenting our research to the team, we agreed to continue with the idea of a lucky amulet as the logo,
          and the basis for the UI. In terms of colour schemes, we were thinking a green as a basis. This was referring
          to the Brazilian flag, and we noticed that it could be a chance to gain a USP, as most our competitors were
          using dark colour schemes.
        </p>
        <h3 class="secondaryCaseTitle">Sketch</h3>
        <p>Moving from paper sketches, we created mockups of logo ideas in Illustrator, and applied iterations based on
          legibility and how colours could be applied.
        </p>

        <p class="caption">We designed quick logo mockups based on the concept of luck and mystery.</p>

        <h3 class="secondaryCaseTitle">Wireframes and prototype</h3>
        <p>We had an existing journey map, but wanted wireframes of every screen to confirm that the flow was
          optimized, with no confusing parts. Over a few days we created the entire site in wireframes.
        </p>
        <img src="/dev/assets/wireframelanding.png" alt="a wireframe of the amuleto landing page.">
        <p class="caption">To confirm the flow of the site, we created wireframes of every screen to use alongside our

          alt="an early version of the landing page is displayed, in desktop and mobile.">
        <p class="caption">An early mockup of the landing page.</p>
        <p>We tried different designs for our UI and logo and found that the idea of luck wasn't working well enough. We
          knew that our targer market in Brazil were interested in both casino games and sports betting,
          and we expected that sports would be a larger user segment than casino games. When we tested our logo with a
          sporty look, the lucky charm design didn't look like it belonged.

        </p>
        <h3 class="secondaryCaseTitle">Test design and iterate</h3>
        <p>We decided to scrap this idea, instead focusing on the idea of luxury and high-level casinos. As our product
          owner said, “Imagine James Bond in Monaco instead of a weekend in Las Vegas.”</p>
        <p>Based on our analysis of competitors in the online casino industry, we noticed that many other online casinos
          used bright and flashy designs, so we aimed to stand out by offering a more elegant and refined look. To
          achieve this, we looked at luxury brands that used simple and understated designs with muted colors.
        </p>

        <p class="caption">To contrast the colourful game tiles, we kept the overall UI subtle and restrained.</p>

        <p>We made many changes to the layout, logos, images, and text until we were satisfied. We
          also tested the logo to make sure it looked good in a sports setting. Once the product team was happy with the
          updated logo and brand idea, we applied the new design to the wireframes.</p>

        <h2 class="secondaryCaseTitle">Result</h2>

        <p>The product was launched in spring 2022, and had overall positive user feedback including:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>• The AmuletoBet name was recognised as specifically designed for Brazil</li>

          <li>• The style focusing on luxury was seen as visually appealing. </li>
        </ul>
