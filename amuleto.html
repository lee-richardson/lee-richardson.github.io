                <p>For half a year, I collaborated closely with another designer to develop
                  a new brand. Our focus was to create a unique user interface, create an inviting landing page, and
                  streamline the signup process.

        <p>A product team was created to focus on the brand, working in <span class="boldText">agile sprints.</span> A
          product owner was hired in
          Brazil, to give cultural context and insights. The rest of the team included:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>• Stakeholders (business analyst, payments and risk)</li>
          <li>• Developers</li>
          <li>• Two designers - myself and another product designer, collaborating daily.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="caption">Some initial notes from the project kickoff meeting focusing on business requirements.</p>
        <p>To launch in line with the team’s backlog, <span class="boldText">business requirements</span> wanted to
          redesign another Hero product and
          brand it ‘AmuletoBet’. This would be a <span class="boldText">Minimum Viable Product (MVP),</span> keeping the
          existing product’s user
          journey. This meant design work was to create a brand identity and redesign the homepage to drive new users
          into the signup flow. Our <span class="boldText">Key Performance Indicator (KPI)</span>
          focused on a new user signing up and completing a first deposit into their digital wallet.</p>

        <img src="/dev/assets/amu-3.png" alt="We were tasked with redesigning this existing Hero product.">
        <p class="caption">We were tasked with redesigning this existing Hero product.</p>

        <h3 class="secondaryCaseTitle">Define</h3>
        <p>We had a <span class="boldText">competitor analysis</span> session to learn more about the market and give us
          clear evidence for our design
          decisions. We chose 8 direct competitors and defined parameters, including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>• The user journey, focusing on the path to signup and first deposit.</li>
          <li>• Design patterns.</li>
          <li>• Visual UI design.</li>
          <li>• Dark UX patterns.</li>
        </ul>
        <img src="/dev/assets/amu-4.png" alt="A screenshot of competitor sites.">
        <p class="caption">I took screenshots during competitor analysis to track user flows, focusing on signup.</p>
        <p>In terms of UI, we quickly noticed the competition was not localized to Brazil. Instead, sites designed in
          Asia, Europe and the US offered Brazilian players an identical homepage design with a language selector. This
          gave us an opportunity for an <span class="boldText">Unique-Selling-Point (USP)</span> to design the homepage
          to cater to a Brazilian audience. </p>
        <img src="/dev/assets/amu-5.png" alt="Another screenshot of competitor sites.">
        <p class="caption">During competitor analysis we noticed products shared aesthetic features, which gave us an
          opportunity to differentiate our product.</p>

        <p>In terms of UX, we found competitors required a new user to sign up to access features, and even to see which
          games were offered. For our user flow, we focused on:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>• Highlighting our features and USPs on the homepage to boost user’s interest.
          </li>
          <li>• Allow games to be played in a ‘free-to-play’ mode, to motivate users to sign up and play for real.
          </li>
          <li>• Ease-of-use around the signup flow. Starting the flow should be no more than three clicks away from any
            screen.
          </li>
          <li>• After signup or login, users are directed to the product’s sport betting features, and not casino games.
            This was to attract users into initially using the product.</li>
        </ul>
        <img src="/dev/assets/amu-6.png" alt="A notebook showing notes about layout of the landing screen.">
        <p class="caption">A rough sketch of landing page ideation, with focus on USPs.</p>
        <p>We <span class="boldText">presented our findings</span> to the product team and used a 4-hour <span
            class="boldText">brainstorming</span> workshop to iterate brand
          directions. We ended with four possible options.</p>

        <p class="caption">Early UI ideas for the brand directions helped show our design thinking.</p>
        <p>We presented these in a product team meeting, with the casino chip idea being chosen to develop because of
          its link to casino games and the green-and-yellow design being an USP based on the Brazilian flag. I wanted
          to confirm the <span class="boldText">user flow</span> was optimized to improve signup rates. This meant
          investigating the site’s structure.
          Over a day, I created a <span class="boldText">sitemap</span> that gave a view of how the screens are
          prioritized, related and categorized.</p>
        <img src="/dev/assets/amu-10.png" alt="A screenshot of the sitemap.">

        <h3 class="secondaryCaseTitle">Develop</h3>
        <p>I created <span class="boldText">low-fidelity prototypes</span> of the entire product. We <span
            class="boldText">guerilla tested</span> with five employees of Hero
          Gaming outside of the AmuletoBet product team. The <span class="boldText">task-completion</span> list was:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>• Starting from the landing page, complete the signup flow.</li>
          <li>• Make a first deposit into their digital wallet.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Overall results were positive with no issues raised.</p>
        <img src="/dev/assets/amu-12.png" alt="Screenshot of wireframes.">
        <p class="caption">Wireframes that we guerilla user tested to gather insights into the flow.</p>
        <p>While working on the UI, we realized that the lucky casino chip design didn’t connect with the brand. Product
          management were now expecting the product’s sports features would be more popular than the casino games. When
          we tested the logo on sports-focused material, the design felt out of place. Also the design didn’t stand out
          when placed against competitors.</p>
        <img src="/dev/assets/amu-13.png" alt="Screenshot of discarded user interface idea.">
        <p class="caption">We created this brand direction, but decided to rework our focus because of a disconnect
          between the UI and sports imagery.</p>
        <p>In a meeting with the product team, we decided to scrap this idea and focus on another previously defined
          idea around luxury. We began more <span class="boldText">competitor analysis</span> and noticed aesthetics
          based on game assets and cartoon
          mascots. To stand out with an elegant and refined design, we researched brands connected with luxury. As our
          product owner said, “Imagine James Bond in Monaco instead of a weekend in Las Vegas.” This was now our USP.
        </p>
        <p>Through <span class="boldText">iteration,</span> we created a dark colour palette that signified luxury and
          high-end brands. In week-long
          ideation sessions, the logo developed into a combined ‘A’ and ‘B’ representing AmuletoBet. During <span
            class="boldText">guerilla
            user testing</span> with five Hero employees, this was found to be more readable on the dark UI than the
          original concept.</p>

        <p class="caption">Development of the logo, from top-left to bottom-right.</p>

        <p class="caption">We tried different imagery to highlight the idea of giving users a luxury experience.</p>
        <p>In terms of UX, I created <span class="boldText">wireframes</span> of every screen, and cross-checked them
          against the site map to confirm
          the user journey made sense. In order to speed up the UI workflow, I built a <span class="boldText">design
            system</span> using components
          designed by myself and my colleague. Based on the wireframes, I then spent a few days creating <span
            class="boldText">high-fidelity
            prototypes</span> in Figma with the UI applied.</p>

        <p class="caption">We built high-fidelity prototypes to confirm the user flow met our goals. I created a design
          system to speed up the process.</p>
        <p>To solve the business requirement of getting users to the signup flow quickly, we contained the signup flow
          in a sliding drawer, which was always accessible from the sidebar menu when logged out. We <span
            class="boldText">guerilla tested</span> the
          core user flow with 5 Hero Gaming employees who were unfamiliar with the product. Each test confirmed that the
          signup flow was easy to find and understandable, and was completed with no issues.</p>

        <p>Comfortable that the user flow met our <span class="boldText">product goals,</span> the UI was checked. We
          focused on readability and meeting <span class="boldText">accessibility standards,</span> before presenting to
          the product team, and implementing.</p>

        <p> A <span class="boldText">user interviews session</span> carried out
          by an agency in Brazil showed overall positive user feedback including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>• Users were not confused or appeared lost during the main flow of signup and deposit.</li>
          <li>• The aesthetic of high-end casinos was seen as visually appealing and stood against the competition.
          </li>
          <li>• The ‘free-to-play’ mode was appreciated against competitors requiring signup to browse games.</li>
          <li>• The AmuletoBet name was understood to be Brazil-specific.</li>
          <li>• Revenue was €20 million after three months.</li>
