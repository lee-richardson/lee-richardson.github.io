        <h3 class="secondaryCaseTitle">Research</h3>
        <p>In alignment with our team's backlog, business requirements dictated the need to revamp a Hero product and
          rebrand it as 'AmuletoBet', following a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) approach while retaining the existing
          product's user journey.</p>
        <br>
        This meant design work was to create a brand identity and redesign the homepage to
        drive new users into the signup flow. Our Key Performance Indicator (KPI) was centred on new users signing up
        and successfully completing their initial deposit into their digital wallet.
        </p>
        <img src="/dev/assets/amu-3.png" alt="We were tasked with redesigning this existing Hero product.">
        <p class="caption">We were tasked with redesigning this existing Hero product.</p>
        <p>To inform our design decisions with solid market insights, I facilitated a competitor analysis session. We
          selected 8 direct competitors and set evaluation parameters including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>— Analysing the user journey, with a focus on the path leading to signup and first deposit.
          </li>
          <li>— Examining common design patterns.</li>
          <li>— Assessing the visual UI design elements.</li>
          <li>— Identifying any instances of dark UX patterns.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>In terms of UI, we quickly noticed the competition was not localised to Brazil. Instead, sites designed in
          Asia, Europe and the U.S. offered Brazilian players an identical homepage design with a language selector.
          This realisation presented us with an opportunity for a Unique Selling Point (USP), by tailoring the homepage
          to cater specifically to a Brazilian audience.</p>
        <img src="/dev/assets/amu-5.png" alt="We were tasked with redesigning this existing Hero product.">
        <p class="caption">During competitor analysis we focused on signup flows and visual treatments of the products.
        </p>
        <p>Following our competitor analysis, we noticed that most competitors required new users to sign up even just
          to access basic features and view the available games. In response, we set out our assumptions around user
          needs with these objectives:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>— Highlighting our unique features and USPs directly on the homepage to pique user interest without
            necessitating immediate signup.</li>
          <li>— Allowing users to play games in a 'free-to-play' mode, and motivating them to sign up and engage with
            real gameplay.</li>
          <li>— Allow for an easy signup process, with the signup flow accessible within three clicks from any
            screen for maximum ease of use.</li>
          <li>— Upon signup or login, directing users toward the product's sports betting features rather than casino
            games. Based on our product manager’s market assumptions, users would be more interested in sports than
            casino games.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="secondaryCaseTitle">Design</h3>
        <p>We presented our findings to the product team and used a four-hour ideation workshop to iterate brand
          directions. We ended with four possible options. We presented these in a product team meeting, with the casino
          chip idea being chosen to develop because of its visual link to casino games.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I wanted to confirm the user
          flow was optimised to improve signup rates. This meant investigating the site’s structure. Over a day, I
          created a sitemap that gave a view of how the screens are prioritised, related and categorised.</p>

        <p class="caption">Early UI treatments helped show our design thinking to stakeholders.</p>


        <h3 class="secondaryCaseTitle">Prototype</h3>
        <p>I created low-fidelity prototypes of the entire product. To validate the user experience, we conducted
          guerilla testing sessions involving five Hero Gaming employees who were not part of the AmuletoBet product
          team. The task-completion list was:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>— Starting from the landing page, complete the signup flow.</li>
          <li>— Make an initial deposit into their digital wallet.</li>
        </ul>
        <img src="/dev/assets/amu-12.png" alt="Low fidelity wireframes.">
        <p class="caption">We tested five people with low-fidelity wireframe prototypes.</p>
        <p> The overall results of these tests were positive, with no significant issues or concerns raised.
          However, during our work on the UI, we began to realise that the existing casino chip design didn't align with
          the brand's identity. Also product management was anticipating that the product's sports-related features
          would be more popular than the casino games. To address this, we tested the logo on sports-focused material,
          and the design felt out of place.</p>
        <img src="/dev/assets/amu-13.png" alt="Screenshot of discarded user interface idea.">
        <p class="caption">We created this brand direction, but decided to rework our focus because of a disconnect
          between the UI and sports imagery.</p>

        <h3 class="secondaryCaseTitle">Second round of research</h3>

        <p>In a meeting with the product team, we decided to scrap this idea and shift our focus to a previously defined
          idea centred around luxury. As we delved deeper into competitor analysis, we noticed that many competitors
          were relying on aesthetics tied to game assets and cartoon mascots.</p>
        <br>
        <p>To distinguish ourselves with an elegant and refined design, we embarked on research into luxury brands. Our
          goal was to create an USP that echoed the sentiment articulated by our product owner:
          "Imagine James Bond in Monaco instead of a weekend in Las Vegas." This became our guiding principle.</p>


        <h3 class="secondaryCaseTitle">Second round of design</h3>
        <p>Through iteration, we designed a dark colour palette that represented luxury and resonated with high-end
          brands, while we developed a new logo concept. Guerilla user testing sessions involving five Hero employees
          confirmed that this new logo concept was more readable and effective on the user interface compared to our
          original casino-chip idea.</p>

        <img src="/dev/assets/amu-16.png" alt="Screenshot of different landing page imagery.">
        <p class="caption">We iterated imagery to best represent a high-end experience.</p>

        <h3 class="secondaryCaseTitle">Second round of prototyping</h3>
        <p>I created wireframes of every screen, and cross-checked them against the site map to confirm
          the user journey made sense. Based on the wireframes, I then spent a few days creating high-fidelity
          prototypes in Figma with the UI applied.
          To solve the business requirement of getting users to the signup flow quickly, we contained the signup flow in
          a sliding drawer, which was always accessible from the sidebar menu when logged out.</p>
        <br>
        <p>We tested the core user flow with five Hero Gaming employees who were unfamiliar with the product, to
          represent new users. Each test
          confirmed that
          the signup flow was easy to find and understandable, and was completed with no issues.

        <p class="caption">The high-fidelity prototype showing a games catalogue.</p>

        <h3 class="secondaryCaseTitle">Build</h3>
        <p>Confident that the user flow aligned with our product objectives, we shifted our attention to the UI. Our
          focus was on enhancing readability and ensuring compliance with accessibility standards. We presented our work
          to the product team and collaborated with the developers for implementation.</p>
        <br>
        <p>A user interview session, conducted by an agency in Brazil, yielded largely positive feedback from users,
          including:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>— Users displayed clarity and confidence during the core processes of signing up and making a deposit,
            with no
            signs of confusion or feeling lost.</li>
          <li>— The inclusion of a 'free-to-play' mode was well-received, setting us apart from competitors that
            required
            signup to browse games.</li>
          <li>— The AmuletoBet name was understood by users as being specific to Brazil, reinforcing its relevance and
            local
            appeal.</li>
