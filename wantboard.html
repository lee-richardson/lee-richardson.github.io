        <h3 class="secondaryCaseTitle">Discover</h3>
        <p>A large part of succeeding in e-commerce is trust. We had customers but wanted to build trust in the brand to
          improve our <span class="boldText">conversion rate</span> and <span class="boldText">customer
            retention.</span>
        </p>
        <p>To kickoff the feature project, I started the project by facilitating a <span class="boldText">whiteboard
            exercise</span> session with
          Wantboard’s staff. This gave us time to quickly <span class="boldText">ideate</span> and brainstorm ideas
          around trust. This also set up our
          <span class="boldText">benchmarking</span> in how we wanted to stand out against competitors.
        </p>
        <p>To understand our users and collect <span class="boldText">qualitative data</span>, I created a <span
            class="boldText">survey</span> focusing on online shopping habits,
          and user’s expectations and opinions around Wantboard and other e-commerce brands. This survey was sent
          through an email newsletter and around 40% of users completed the survey. I analyzed the data using <span
            class="boldText">affinity
            mapping</span> to identify patterns and generate new ideas. The grouping of data showed that our users would
          prefer
          more information and clarity during the shopping process.
        </p>
        <p>To get a better understanding of customer trust, I performed a <span class="boldText">competitor
            analysis</span> session. This allowed me
          to focus on e-commerce user flows and see if any common patterns or features emerged.
        </p>
        <h3 class="secondaryCaseTitle">Define</h3>
        <p>Using sketching and <span class="boldText">rapid prototyping</span>, I iterated on providing clear and
          concise product information
          throughout the user journey, from browsing to checkout. This would ensure that users are well-informed about
          what they are buying, with no surprises or unexpected costs.</p>
        <p>After iteration, I decided to introduce a feature of ‘Transparent Pricing’ with a visual breakdown of a
          product’s cost. In the form of an infographic, different cost components such as manufacturing, shipping, and
          labour fees would be shown. This would result in a final price shown before the user gets to the checkout
          stage.
        </p>
        <h3 class="secondaryCaseTitle">Develop</h3>
        <p>I moved on from sketches into <span class="boldText">low-fidelity prototypes</span>, experimenting with
          layout and visual language. Iconography
          was added to bring more visual appeal to the feature. I facilitated a <span class="boldText">user testing
            session</span> over one afternoon,
          viewing how five users interacted with a <span class="boldText">high-fidelity prototype</span> and their
          response to the idea of transparent
          pricing.
        </p>
        <h3 class="secondaryCaseTitle">Deliver</h3>
        <p>With feedback positive, I added a small detail of incorporating the U.S. and Canadian flags into the price
          tags to reflect cross-border prices and provide some contrast. The feature was handed off to developers and
          implemented.</p>
        <h3 class="secondaryCaseTitle">Result</h3>
        <p>After three months, users were surveyed in another email newsletter. Around 45% of users completed the
          survey. <span class="boldText">Quantitative data</span> was collected and compared to the earlier research
          survey. The post-implementation
          survey showed that by displaying the feature on product pages, user trust around shopping with Wantboard had
          increased by 60%.
        </p>

        <p class="caption">The transparent pricing feature allows users to see the full cost of an item before checkout,
          with no
          surprises.</p>
