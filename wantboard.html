                <p>I created a survey to find what users thought about e-commerce brands, and introduced a feature of

        <h3 class="secondaryCaseTitle">Research</h3>
        <p>A significant part of achieving success in e-commerce is establishing trust. While we already had customers,
          business requirements were to enhance trust in our brand, which would lead to improved conversion rates and
          higher customer
          retention.</p>
        <br>
        <p>To kickstart the project, I initiated a whiteboard exercise with Wantboard's team. This session allowed us to
          brainstorm ideas related to trust. It also set the stage for benchmarking, helping us define how we could
          distinguish ourselves from competitors.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In order to gain insights into our users' preferences and gather qualitative data, I designed a survey
          focusing on online shopping habits, user expectations, and opinions related to Wantboard and other e-commerce
          brands. This survey was distributed through our email newsletter, with 40% of our users completing it.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I analysed the collected data using affinity mapping, which revealed patterns of what to focus on in terms of
          new features. Our findings highlighted that users desired more information and clarity throughout the shopping
          process. I carried out competitor analysis to identify any common patterns or features that emerged among
          successful e-commerce products.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I found an interesting user interface element used by Everlane, an ethical clothing company. Focused on
          transparency, their website breaks down the cost of a product through an infographic. This aligned with the
          user needs found in my affinity mapping results, so I decided to follow the idea of introducing this as a
          feature.</p>
        <h3 class="secondaryCaseTitle">Design</h3>
        <p>Since our model had cost components such as sourcing, shipping, and other associated fees, they were added on
          top of the original product price. I aimed to make the pricing more engaging for customers, understanding that
          it shouldn't be a dull list of numbers.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I started sketching ideas on how to represent each fee
          hierarchically. Eventually, I condensed this concept into an 'umbrella' that encompassed all additional fees,
          offering room for small illustrations.</p>
        <img src="/dev/assets/wantwireframe.jpg" alt="A screenshot of the feature.">
        <p class="caption">A wireframe of the feature.</p>
        <p>The goal was to ensure that users had a comprehensive understanding of what they were buying, avoiding any
          surprises or unexpected costs. This approach provided users with a final price before reaching the checkout
          stage, resulting in transparency and user confidence.</p>
        <img src="/dev/assets/redwireframe.jpg" alt="A screenshot of the feature.">
        <p class="caption">Different visual treatments of the feature were explored. This uses the same red shade as the
          brand's logo.</p>
        <h3 class="secondaryCaseTitle">Prototype</h3>
        <p>I moved from initial sketches to creating a low-fidelity prototypes exploring various layouts and visual
          styles, especially for the mobile site. To enhance the visual appeal of the feature, I incorporated icons that
          aimed to give a sense of lightheartedness to the topic of money.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>After a prototype was created, I organised a user testing session over one afternoon. During this
          session, I observed the interactions of five users to learn their thoughts
          around the concept of transparent pricing.</p>
        <h3 class="secondaryCaseTitle">Build</h3>
        <p>After receiving positive feedback, the prototype was refined into the final design, and the feature was
          handed over to developers for implementation. Three months later, we conducted another user survey through an
          email newsletter. We collected qualitative data and compared it an earlier survey, which revealed that the
          feature had increased user trust.</p>

        <p class="caption">The transparent pricing feature allows users to see the full cost of an item before checkout,
