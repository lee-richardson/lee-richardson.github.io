              <p>Responding to both business and user needs, I looked into the signup flow of a popular Japanese
                product, which was suffering becuase of a lack of localised features.

              <p>We noticed in the first week of May that the number of new customers completing the signup flow had
                been declining for almost 2 weeks, since April 29. The design team was
                assigned to look into it along with a product manager.</p>

      <h3 class="secondaryCaseTitle">Research</h3>
      <p>Through customer support, we found that our NPS (net promoter score) was 34/100 and in a negative trend. This
        was a priority to fix for the business.
        Business goals were set as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>— New users: Less friction and more motivation to sign up.
        </li>
        <li>— Returning users: Understand that the product is localised to users’ market, to win retention.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Assessing and benchmarking UX</h4>
      <p>Customer support was getting comments on the signup process as difficult, with users taking 7-10 minutes to
        sign up.</p>
      <p>We carried out a System Usability Scale (SUS) survey through email, with users who had registered their email
        but not completed the
        signup flow. The score was a 27, which was classed as an F (failure). 16 people filled out the survey.
      </p>
      <img src="/dev/assets/susscale.jpg" alt="The System Usability Scale in an infographic chart.">
      <p class="caption">The System Usability Scale (SUS). Our signup flow had a score of 27 (F). </p>
      <p>This was potentially the reason why people were completing the first step, entering email and password. But
        not completing the second step.
      </p>
      <img src="/dev/assets/steps.jpg" alt="A sccrenshot of the two screens of the signup flow.">
      <p class="caption">The signup flow is made of two steps, first entering email and password, and second entering
        address and contact information </p>
      <h4>Customer support</h4>
      <p>We learned from our customer support team that we had been receiving comments about signup being
        diffcult for one and a half months, since March 22.</p>
      <h4>UX audit</h4>
      <p>I reviewed the signup flow, analysed users' movements using Hotjar, and spoke with product management and
        developers.</p>
      <img src="/dev/assets/uxaudit1.jpg" alt="A screenshot of the ux audit.">
      <img src="/dev/assets/uxaudit2.jpg" alt="Another screenshot of the ux audit.">
      <p class="caption">As well as looking at Hotjar data, I went through the flow and highlighted findings.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>— Due to our database setup, users are expected to use English alphabet / characters during the signup
          process. For a Japan only product, this is not very intuitive and not respectful of our users.
        </li>
        <li>— 68% of users spend over one minute entering their birthdate. Because of the way the forms are labelled,
          these users are not fully clear that they are expected to enter their birthdate.</li>
        <li>— Users are required to choose their country of residence, even though the only choice available in the
          dropdown is Japan.
        </li>
        <li>— A banner headline is competing against the main signup headline.
        </li>
        <li>— Visual spacing/whitespace can be adjusted. </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Decision</h4>
      <p>First priority is reworking database setup to allow for Japanese characters. This would meet our localisation
        goals.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Second area to improve was address input. Business goals decided to introduce Google Maps API to autofill
        addresses. Our expectation is Japanese users would then be able to complete the signup flow easier, resulting in
        less friction.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>Third area to improve is adding password validation. This would modernise our product and bring a sense of
        added security. Potential wins with end-users:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>— Privacy (email is validated).</li>
        <li>— Security (password is secure).</li>
        <li>— Customer service (we take user data seriously).</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <p>Fourth area is relabelling date-of-birth form.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Last priority is fixing visual hierarchy issues.</p>


      <h3 class="secondaryCaseTitle">Design</h3>
      <p>Requirements for the designs were concluded from both the user survey, findings from Hotjar data analytics and
        ux audit:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>— Simplify signup process.
        </li>
        <li>— Must be mobile-first (90% sessions).
        </li>
        <li>— Must be able to clear password and start again after validation.</li>
        <li>— Password validation must visually show requirements.
        </li>
        <li>— Must allow option to add address manually (edge cases).</li>
        <li>— Clean up visual hierarchy (fonts, whitespace).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Exploration</h4>
      <p>I used wireframes for quick experimentation with design patterns including layout, hierarchy, and components.
      </p>
      <img src="/dev/assets/threewireframes.jpg" alt="A screenshot of three wireframes.">
      <p class="caption">These wireframes show different layouts of the password validation list.</p>
      <p>While working on design for password validation, the original idea was to use green text to align with our
        ‘success’ green. This failed readability testing, so we decided to use black on white for the final UI.
      </p>
      <img src="/dev/assets/greentext.jpg" alt="A screenshot of the exploration of the validation.">
      <p class="caption">Exploration of colour for the password validation list.</p>
      <p>Work progressed from wireframes to the prototypes.</p>
      <img src="/dev/assets/improve-japanesecharacters.jpg" alt="The first area of improvement.">
      <p class="caption">The highest priority area of improvement was making sure Japanese users could use Japanese
        characters. A backend developer worked on this.</p>
      <img src="/dev/assets/improve-autofilladdress.jpg" alt="The second area of improvement.">
      <p class="caption">The second priority was incorporating the Google Maps API to autofill addresses based on the
        postcode. This meant less friction for users.</p>
      <img src="/dev/assets/improve-dropdownaddress.jpg" alt="The third area of improvement.">
      <p class="caption">The third priority was removing the country selector dropdown. This form was redundant and was
        causing confusion, according to the customer support team.</p>
      <img src="/dev/assets/improve-passwordvalidation.jpg" alt="The fourth area of improvement.">
      <p class="caption">The fourth priority was adding password validation to ensure a sense of security and trust
        around the brand.</p>
      <img src="/dev/assets/improve-datelabel.jpg" alt="The fifth area of improvement.">
      <p class="caption">The fifth priority was simplifying the birthdate form by changing the label.</p>
      <img src="/dev/assets/improve-banner.jpg" alt="The sixth area of improvement.">
      <p class="caption">The sixth priority was adjusting weight of fonts and spacing to improve visual hierarchy.</p>


      <h3 class="secondaryCaseTitle">Validation</h3>
      <img src="/dev/assets/validation-passwordlist.jpg"
        alt="The password validation list and some validation information.">
      <p>Data showed that users understood the list of password requirements, leading to 40% less time spent on this
        step.</p>
      <img src="/dev/assets/validation-autoaddress.jpg"
        alt="The address autofill feature and some validation information.">
      <p>Data showed that address autofill resulted in less calls to customer support, and less frustration when
        interacting with the form.</p>
      <img src="/dev/assets/validation-birthdate.jpg" alt="The birthdate adjustment and some validation information.">
      <p>Data showed that less time was spent filling the birthdate form, and much less frustration.</p>

      <img src="/dev/assets/validation-overall.jpg" alt="The before and after steps and some validation information.">
      <p>Product management was happy with the 73% positive change to signup conversions in the two weeks after
        implementation.</p>

      <h4>Before</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>— Not designed for the Japanese market.</li>
        <li>— SUS score of 27 (F).</li>
        <li>— NPS score 34/100.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>After</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>— Redefined flows, features for localisation.</li>
        <li>— SUS score of 82 (B).</li>
        <li>— NPS score 72/100.</li>
