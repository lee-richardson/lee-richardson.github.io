                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>Business requirements meant a full redesign of the product was needed. I was hired as product
                  designer to understand the product, optimize the UX flow and update the UI. I worked on this for a
                  year as the only designer.</p>

                <h3>The challenge</h3>
                <p>Our users completed their work tasks on different devices in different locations - coffee shops, in
                  their
                  cars, and while talking with clients. This meant ease-of-use of UX and an understandable UI was a
                  priority.</p>

              <div class="whatelement">
                <h3>The goal</h3>
                <p>Improve overall functionality and the user experience compared to our competitors. The product should
                  be
                  easy to pick up and use, taking advantage of existing mental models and design patterns. A product
                  team
                  consisting of a product owner, developers, and myself as designer was formed.</p>

        <p>The product team had a <span class="boldText">project kickoff</span> where we defined project milestones,
          aligned on <span class="boldText">key performance
            indicators (KPIs)</span> and created a shared product vision. The meeting allowed us to identify <span
            class="boldText">return on investment
            (ROI),</span> find any risks and understand any technical constraints.

        <p class="caption">Notes from the project kickoff meeting.</p>
        <p>In terms of <span class="boldText">UX benchmarking,</span> we wanted to confirm we were offering a good user
          experience by focusing on a <span class="boldText">user-centric</span> design process. This required user
          testing and investigating data
          analytics.</p>
        <p>Work began in <span class="boldText">agile sprints.</span> I carried out a <span class="boldText">competitor
            analysis</span> session, analyzing direct competition in the
          real estate space, and other products using digital signatures and document sharing features. Screenshots and
          video recordings of <span class="boldText">user flows</span> were created to compare <span
            class="boldText">design patterns</span> and overall user experience.</p>
        <img src="/dev/assets/deal-4.png" alt="A screenshot of some competitor research.">
        <p class="caption">My competitor analysis research explored visual hierarchy and design patterns.</p>
        <p>With business requirements set up, I needed to find <span class="boldText">user requirements.</span> I set up
          sessions over five days for
          <span class="boldText">user interviews</span> and <span class="boldText">usability testing.</span> Six real
          estate agents were invited, ranging from beginners to advanced ‘power’ users. As facilitator, I managed the
          sessions with support from the product manager.
        </p>
        <img src="/dev/assets/deal-5.png" alt="A notebook with notes from the user testing session.">
        <p class="caption">Some notes from the first user testing session.</p>
        <p>Based on business requirements, I wanted to focus testing on the product’s core user journey. I created a
          task-completion checklist of:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>• Creating a new deal document package.</li>
          <li>• Adding relevant documents to the document package.</li>
          <li>Adding their digital signature.</li>
          <li>Sharing documents to a client (dummy email address for testing purposes).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Users were recorded during the testing. We then ran a <span class="boldText">card-sorting</span> session for
          feedback on the product’s user
          journey, and <span class="boldText">interviewed</span> users with open-ended questions to understand how they
          used the product.</p>
        <p>After the testing was complete, I compared task-completion times and used a <span class="boldText">mind
            map</span> to compare interviews.
          All this data allowed me to identify these pain points:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>• Beginner users adding digital signatures to documents.</li>
          <li>• Beginner users not able to keep track of document history.</li>
          <li>Adding their digital signature.</li>
          <li>All users unclear around saving documents and digital signatures (and auto-save feature).</li>
        </ul>
        <P>These issues were classified as high impact, meaning they prevented users from completing the user journey.
          Other issues were categorized as moderate or low impact, and added to the product backlog to be fixed at a
          later date. Overall, the testing indicated areas to focus on:
        </P>
        <ul>
          <li>• Creating a new deal document package.</li>
          <li>• Adding their digital signature to documents.</li>
          <li>• Sharing documents</li>
          <li>• Organizing deal document packages</li>
          <li>• Making the auto-save feature easier to understand</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="secondaryCaseTitle">Define</h3>
        <p>Data from the user interviews allowed me to create three <span class="boldText">personas.</span> These were
          used to guide my design decisions when considering user demographics.
        </p>
        <img src="/dev/assets/deal-7.png" alt="Screenshot showing the first persona, the everyday user.">
        <img src="/dev/assets/deal-8.png" alt="Screenshot showing the second persona, the beginner user.">
        <img src="/dev/assets/deal-9.png" alt="Screenshot showing the third persona, the hesitant user.">
        <p class="caption">I developed three personas based on my user testing interviews.</p>
        <p>At this point product management supported me in creating an advisory board of users. Once a month, the board
          would be invited into a <span class="boldText">focus group</span> session to give their opinions on product
          developments.
        </p>
        <p>I began brainstorming an <span class="boldText">Information Architecture</span> to plan the product
          structure. We knew our users wanted
          access to documents quickly, so using the personas was key in deciding how to structure core navigation, and
          making sure that the functionality was laid out in a way that made sense. Affinity diagramming helped me
          organize ideas.

        </p>
        <h3 class="secondaryCaseTitle">Develop</h3>
        <p>The next step was <span class="boldText">ideation,</span> using sketching to quickly map out ideas for user
          flows.
          Through iteration, I created a flow that influenced the <span class="boldText">sitemap.</span> This gave me a
          product overview, and helped me
          understand the relationships between screens.
        </p>

        <p class="caption">Part of a sitemap I created to develop a user flow through interactions and their relations.
        </p>
        <p>A main idea involved reworking the dashboard interface, which would offer quicker access to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>• Recent deal packages.</li>
          <li>• Most used documents.</li>
          <li>Recent contacts.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I used existing design patterns and UX mental models to explore visual treatments and layouts. My sketches
          were iterated and developed into digital <span class="boldText">wireframes</span> to clearly show the user
          journey.</p>
        <img src="/dev/assets/deal-15.png" alt="A screenshot of a digital wireframe for document upload.">
        <p class="caption">A wireframe of a document upload feature, using existing mental models and design patterns.
        </p>
        <p>I wanted to test the user journey, and set up another <span class="boldText">usability testing</span> session
          over a one‐week period with six
          users. This helped me decide if functionality met user needs. Feedback was positive, with users appreciating
          the dashboard interface and emphasis on recent activity.
        </p>
        <p>Happy with the updated UX flow, work began on the UI, and I felt the introduction of a <span
            class="boldText">design
            system</span> would speed up my workflow. I spent a week creating components, prioritizing for mobile
          devices. I also began work on a styleguide, making decisions on a colour palette and typography.
        </p>
        <img src="/dev/assets/deal-16.png" alt="A screenshot showing the work-in-progress design system.">
        <p class="caption">I created components and began categorizing them into different states and flows.</p>
        <p>In terms of UI, legibility was a huge factor, as features had to be easily accessible in the different
          environments real estate agents work in, including outdoors or low-light conditions.
        </p>
        <img src="/dev/assets/dt1-final.png" alt="A screenshot of the new digital signature process.">

        <h3 class="secondaryCaseTitle">Deliver</h3>
        <p>While I was in the stage of working on the UI, business strategies meant that Dealtap was acquired by Remine,
          a real estate platform based in the U.S..</p>
        <h3 class="secondaryCaseTitle">Result</h3>
        <p>My UX research was added to Remine’s plans around their product optimization.</p>
