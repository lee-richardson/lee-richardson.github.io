        <h2 class="caseTitle">The challenge</h2>
        <p>Give a better experience to our users.</p>
        <h2 class="caseTitle">The goal</h2>
        <p>Improve functionality and the user experience compared to competitors, and to design easy-to-use interfaces.
          A product team consisting of a product owner, developers, and myself as designer was formed.
        </p>
        <h2 class="caseTitle">The process</h2>

        <h3 class="secondaryCaseTitle">Understand</h3>
        <p>To start things off, we did a lot of research. We looked at the timeline for the project, what other similar
          websites were doing, and looked at the technical side of things to see if there were any limitations we needed
          to be aware of.
          I organized a one-day workshop with stakeholders to kick off the project. We looked at what other websites
          like ours were doing and what information we had about how users use our website.
        </p>
        <p>
          We talked specifically about the most important things our website does, like making new documents, filling
          out forms, and signing and sharing documents. We wanted to make sure we were doing these things well and see
          if there were any ways we could improve them.
        </p>
        <h3 class="secondaryCaseTitle">Research</h3>
        <p>I looked at other similar websites to see what they were doing well and what we could learn from them.
          Looking at websites that weren't just related to real estate gave me new ideas about how to add signature
          functionality.</p>
        <img src="/dev/assets/competition@2x.png" alt="devices showing real estate and electronic signature tools">
        <p class="caption">Research into other products aimed at real estate agents.</p>
        <p>I conducted user testing to ensure it met the needs of real estate agents. During a week-long testing
          session, agents of different experience levels completed tasks. We then ran card-sorting sessions to gather
          user feedback on the app's structure, and conducted interviews to understand their daily work processes using
          DealTap.</p>
        <img src="/dev/assets/dt-cardsorting.jpg" alt="a man sticking a sticky not on a whiteboard.">
        <p class="caption">Card-sorting sessions helped us understand user needs.</p>


        <h3 class="secondaryCaseTitle">Analyze</h3>
        <p>I compared task completion times and identified pain points. The most common issues were related to signing
          documents, document history, and auto-save.
          These issues were classified as high impact, meaning they prevented users from completing other tasks. Other
          issues were categorized as moderate or low impact.
        </p>
        <p>I used feedback from users to identify three personas and used them to guide our ideas. Testing showed that
          users needed faster access to main features, so we focused on improving offer generation, sign and share, and
          PDF markup.

        <p class="caption">Three personas were created to guide our decision making.</p>

        <h3 class="secondaryCaseTitle">Sketch</h3>
        <p>After identifying the main plot points, I defined the primary paths the personas would take through the app.
          Creating several user journeys for each of our personas was the best way to structure content and
          functionality.
          Using storyboards, I generated ideas about the arrangement of UI, functional and data elements, and
          interactive behaviours.

        <p class="caption">Paper sketches helped flesh out ideas for flow optimization.</p>
        <h3 class="secondaryCaseTitle">Wireframes and prototype</h3>
        <p>Wireframing helped interactions and the layout to come together. When we had a fleshed-out user journey, we
          ran usability testing over a one-week period for feedback on if the new changes met user needs.</p>

        <p class="caption">Skeleton wireframes were produced and tested by power users.</p>

        <h3 class="secondaryCaseTitle">Test design and iterate</h3>
        <p>Following user testing I began work on a new design system based on common UI patterns, with a focus on
          meeting web accessibility standards.
          The new UI aimed to eliminate any unnecessary elements, with a clear, readable typography and a high-contrast
          color theme. We prioritized readability, as real estate agents often work outdoors and in low-light
          conditions.
        </p>

        <p class="caption">Some of the new components that were created.</p>
        <h2 class="caseTitle">Result</h2>
        <p>While work on the UI was ongoing, Dealtap was acquired by Remine, a U.S. real estate platform. This UX
          research was added to its plans around product optimization.
