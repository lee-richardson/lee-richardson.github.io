        <h3 class="secondaryCaseTitle">Research</h3>
        <p>The product team had a kickoff meeting to define project milestones, align on key performance indicators
          (KPIs), and create a strategic vision. We also identified potential risks, and gained insights into any
          technical constraints that could impact the project.</p>
        <br>
        <p>To ensure that our product remained user-centric, I conducted a benchmarking exercise. This involved a
          competitor analysis session, where I examined products in the real estate domain as well as other products
          that featured digital signatures and document sharing capabilities. This analysis gave insights
          into design patterns and the overall user experience, enabling us to refine our approach.</p>
        <img src="/dev/assets/dealold.jpg" alt="A screenshot of the previous Dealtap design.">
        <p class="caption">The previous design of Dealtap’s homescreen. Business requirements wanted an update.</p>

        <p>In terms of business requirements, our high level goals were to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>— Become superior against market leaders.</li>
          <li>— Build an end-to-end solution for all users.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>With a concept of what the new DealTap should be, we had to ask users what they needed. Over the
          course of a week, we invited in five real estate agents for testing. I set up a series of tasks involving the
          typical user journey. Participants consisted of real estate agents with different levels of experience with
          DealTap, from novices to ‘power’ users.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Based on business requirements, I wanted to focus the testing on the product’s core user journey. I created a
          task-completion checklist of:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>— Creating a new deal document package.</li>
          <li>— Adding relevant documents to the document package.</li>
          <li>— Adding their digital signature.</li>
          <li>— Sharing documents to a client (dummy email address for testing purposes).</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>After testing the functionality, we ran a series of card sorting sessions, which allowed us to find users
          high-level thoughts around the structure of the app. After testing, we interviewed every agent about their
          process using DealTap and their typical daily work. Users were also asked to imagine their ideal product, with
          no technical restrictions.</p>
        <img src="/dev/assets/test1.jpg" alt="A photo of notes from users about their ideal app.">
        <img src="/dev/assets/test2.jpg" alt="Another photo of notes from users about their ideal app.">
        <p class="caption">To gain inspiration into features and users needs, Users were asked to imagine their ideal
          product, thinking of tech in the year 2025.</p>


        <p>We then ran a card-sorting session for feedback on the product’s user journey, and interviewed users with
          open-ended questions to understand how they used the product.</p>
        <br>
        <p>After the testing was complete, I compared
          task-completion times and used a mind map to categorise the results of the user feedback sessions. All this
          data allowed me to identify these pain points:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>— Beginner users adding digital signatures to documents.</li>
          <li>— Beginner users not able to keep track of document history.</li>
          <li>— All users unclear around saving documents and digital signatures (and auto-save feature).</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>These issues were classified as high impact, meaning they prevented users from completing the user journey.
          Other issues were categorised as moderate or low impact, and added to the product backlog to be fixed at a
          later date. Overall, the testing indicated areas to focus on:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>— Creating a new deal document package.</li>
          <li>— Adding their digital signature to documents.</li>
          <li>— Organising deal document packages.</li>
          <li>— Making the auto-save feature easier to understand.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>I entered all the ideas into a spreadsheet and prioritised them against our personas needs, tech feasibility,
          and business objectives. This informed our phasing strategy for the app, and the product feature roadmap.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Data from the user interviews allowed me to create three personas. These were used to guide my design
          decisions when considering user demographics. At this point product management supported me in creating an
          advisory board of users. Once a month, the board would be invited into a focus group session to give their
          opinions on product developments.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I began gathering an Information Architecture to plan the product structure. We knew our users wanted
          access to documents quickly, so using the personas was key in deciding how to structure core navigation, and
          making sure that the functionality was laid out in a way that made sense. Affinity diagramming helped me
          organise and prioritise ideas.</p>

        </p>
        <h3 class="secondaryCaseTitle">Design</h3>
        <p>The next step was ideation, using sketching to quickly map out ideas for user flows. Through iteration, I
          created a sitemap. This gave me a product overview, and helped me understand the relationships between
          screens.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I used common design patterns and UX mental models to explore visual treatments and layouts. My sketches
          were iterated and developed into wireframes to clearly show the user journey.
          I explored different visual treatments and changes in layouts, and how they could affect the typical user
          journey. Sketching and storyboarding, I generated ideas about the arrangement of UI, functional and data
          elements, and interactive behaviours.</p>

        <p class="caption">A sketch to help find ideas for the login flow.</p>
        </p>
        <h3 class="secondaryCaseTitle">Prototype</h3>
        <p>I wanted to test the user journey, and set up another usability testing session over a one‐week period with
          six users. This helped me decide if functionality met user needs. Feedback was positive, with users
          appreciating the dashboard interface and emphasis on recent activity to reduce cognitive load.

        <h3 class="secondaryCaseTitle">Build</h3>
        <p>Happy with the updated UX flow, work began on the UI, creating components and prioritising for mobile
          devices. I also began work on a styleguide, making decisions on a colour palette and typography. While I was
          in the stage of working on the UI, business strategies meant that Dealtap was acquired by Remine, a real
          estate platform based in the U.S.. My UX research was added to Remine’s plans around their product
          optimisation.</p>
